<p id="p01025019_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01025019-1">19&nbsp;</b>These are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham fathered Isaac, <b class="verse-num" id="v01025020-1">20&nbsp;</b>and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife. <b class="verse-num" id="v01025021-1">21&nbsp;</b>And Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived. <b class="verse-num" id="v01025022-1">22&nbsp;</b>The children struggled together within her, and she said, “If it is thus, why is this happening to me?”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;why&lt;/span&gt; do I live?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> So she went to inquire of the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v01025023-1">23&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to her,</p>

<p id="p01025026_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01025027-1">27&nbsp;</b>When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. <b class="verse-num" id="v01025028-1">28&nbsp;</b>Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>

<p id="p01025028_11-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01025029-1">29&nbsp;</b>Once when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted. <b class="verse-num" id="v01025030-1">30&nbsp;</b>And Esau said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am exhausted!” (Therefore his name was called Edom.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Edom&lt;/i&gt; sounds like the Hebrew for &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;red&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup>) <b class="verse-num" id="v01025031-1">31&nbsp;</b>Jacob said, “Sell me your birthright now.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01025032-1">32&nbsp;</b>Esau said, “I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?” <b class="verse-num" id="v01025033-1">33&nbsp;</b>Jacob said, “Swear to me now.” So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob. <b class="verse-num" id="v01025034-1">34&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.</p>

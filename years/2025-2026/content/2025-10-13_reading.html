<p id="p01011027_03-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01011027-1">27&nbsp;</b>Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot. <b class="verse-num" id="v01011028-1">28&nbsp;</b>Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his kindred, in Ur of the Chaldeans. <b class="verse-num" id="v01011029-1">29&nbsp;</b>And Abram and Nahor took wives. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah. <b class="verse-num" id="v01011030-1">30&nbsp;</b>Now Sarai was barren; she had no child.</p>
<p id="p01011030_03-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01011031-1">31&nbsp;</b>Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife, and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan, but when they came to Haran, they settled there. <b class="verse-num" id="v01011032-1">32&nbsp;</b>The days of Terah were 205 years, and Terah died in Haran.</p>

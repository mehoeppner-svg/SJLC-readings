Into your hand they are delivered. <b class="verse-num" id="v01009003-1">3&nbsp;</b>Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything. <b class="verse-num" id="v01009004-1">4&nbsp;</b>But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood. <b class="verse-num" id="v01009005-1">5&nbsp;</b>And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning: from every beast I will require it and from man. From his fellow man I will require a reckoning for the life of man.</p>

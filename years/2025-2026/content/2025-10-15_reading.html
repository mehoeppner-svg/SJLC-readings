<p id="p01012010_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01012010-1">10&nbsp;</b>Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land. <b class="verse-num" id="v01012011-1">11&nbsp;</b>When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance, <b class="verse-num" id="v01012012-1">12&nbsp;</b>and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me, but they will let you live. <b class="verse-num" id="v01012013-1">13&nbsp;</b>Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01012014-1">14&nbsp;</b>When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. <b class="verse-num" id="v01012015-1">15&nbsp;</b>And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. <b class="verse-num" id="v01012016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.</p>
<p id="p01012016_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01012017-1">17&nbsp;</b>But the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. <b class="verse-num" id="v01012018-1">18&nbsp;</b>So Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? <b class="verse-num" id="v01012019-1">19&nbsp;</b>Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01012020-1">20&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.</p>

<h3 id="p01021001_01-1">The Birth of Isaac</h3>
<p id="p01021001_05-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01021001-1">21&nbsp;</b>The LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had promised. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021003-1">3&nbsp;</b>Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Isaac&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;he laughs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v01021004-1">4&nbsp;</b>And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01021007-1">7&nbsp;</b>And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”</p>
<h3 id="p01021007_05-1">God Protects Hagar and Ishmael</h3>
<p id="p01021007_10-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01021008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021009-1">9&nbsp;</b>But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, laughing.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Possibly &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;laughing&lt;/span&gt; in mockery&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v01021010-1">10&nbsp;</b>So she said to Abraham, “Cast out this slave woman with her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01021011-1">11&nbsp;</b>And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021012-1">12&nbsp;</b>But God said to Abraham, “Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021013-1">13&nbsp;</b>And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01021014-1">14&nbsp;</b>So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.</p>
<p id="p01021014_10-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01021015-1">15&nbsp;</b>When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021016-1">16&nbsp;</b>Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, “Let me not look on the death of the child.” And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.</p>

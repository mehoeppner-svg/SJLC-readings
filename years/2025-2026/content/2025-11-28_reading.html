This is what their father said to them as he blessed them, blessing each with the blessing suitable to him. <b class="verse-num" id="v01049029-1">29&nbsp;</b>Then he commanded them and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, <b class="verse-num" id="v01049030-1">30&nbsp;</b>in the cave that is in the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place. <b class="verse-num" id="v01049031-1">31&nbsp;</b>There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah—<b class="verse-num" id="v01049032-1">32&nbsp;</b>the field and the cave that is in it were bought from the Hittites.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01049033-1">33&nbsp;</b>When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed and breathed his last and was gathered to his people.</p>
<p id="p01050001_14-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01050001-1">50&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph fell on his father’s face and wept over him and kissed him. <b class="verse-num" id="v01050002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel. <b class="verse-num" id="v01050003-1">3&nbsp;</b>Forty days were required for it, for that is how many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.</p>
<p id="p01050003_14-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01050004-1">4&nbsp;</b>And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, <b class="verse-num" id="v01050005-1">5&nbsp;</b>‘My father made me swear, saying, “I am about to die: in my tomb that I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.” Now therefore, let me please go up and bury my father. Then I will return.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v01050006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh answered, “Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01050007-1">7&nbsp;</b>So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, <b class="verse-num" id="v01050008-1">8&nbsp;</b>as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s household.

<p id="p01050014_17-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01050015-1">15&nbsp;</b>When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil that we did to him.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01050016-1">16&nbsp;</b>So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this command before he died: <b class="verse-num" id="v01050017-1">17&nbsp;</b>‘Say to Joseph, “Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.”’ And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him. <b class="verse-num" id="v01050018-1">18&nbsp;</b>His brothers also came and fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01050019-1">19&nbsp;</b>But Joseph said to them, “Do not fear, for am I in the place of God? <b class="verse-num" id="v01050020-1">20&nbsp;</b>As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f16-1" id="fb16-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;a numerous people&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">16</a></sup> should be kept alive, as they are today. <b class="verse-num" id="v01050021-1">21&nbsp;</b>So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones.” Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.</p>

<p id="p01050021_21-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01050022-1">22&nbsp;</b>So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father’s house.

<p id="p01006001_05-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01006001-1">6&nbsp;</b>When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them, <b class="verse-num" id="v01006002-1">2&nbsp;</b>the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive.

These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.</p>
<p id="p01006004_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01006005-1">5&nbsp;</b>The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. <b class="verse-num" id="v01006006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. <b class="verse-num" id="v01006007-1">7&nbsp;</b>So the LORD said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01006008-1">8&nbsp;</b>But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.</p>

He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colors.<sup class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"fn\" href=\"#f1-1\" id=\"fb1-1\" title=\"&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;meaning-uncertain&quot;&gt;See Septuagint, Vulgate; or (with Syriac) &lt;i&gt;a robe with long sleeves&lt;/i&gt;.

And behold, your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>His brothers said to him, “Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to rule over us?” So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.</p>\n<p id=\"p01037008_03-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, “Behold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.</p>\n<h3 id=\"p01037011_03-1\">Joseph Sold by His Brothers</h3>\n<p id=\"p01037011_08-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>Now his brothers went to pasture their father’s flock near Shechem. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.” And he said to him, “Here I am.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>So he said to him, “Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me word.” So he sent him from the Valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>And a man found him wandering in the fields. And the man asked him, “What are you seeking?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>“I am seeking my brothers,” he said. “Tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>And the man said, “They have gone away, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.</p>\n<p id=\"p01037017_08-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>They saw him from afar, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>They said to one another, “Here comes this dreamer. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits.<sup class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"fn\" href=\"#f2-1\" id=\"fb2-1\" title=\"&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;cisterns&lt;/i&gt;; also verses 22, 24&lt;/note&gt;\">2</a></sup> Then we will say that a fierce animal has devoured him, and we will see what will become of his dreams.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>But when Reuben heard it, he rescued him out of their hands, saying, “Let us not take his life.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>And Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood; throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him”—that he might rescue him out of their hand to restore him to his father. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the robe of many colors that he wore. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>And they took him and threw him into a pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.</p>\n<p id=\"p01037024_08-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>Then they sat down to eat. And looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And his brothers listened to him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels<sup class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"fn\" href=\"#f3-1\" id=\"fb3-1\" title=\"&lt;note class=&quot;background&quot; sub-class=&quot;measurement&quot;&gt;A &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word-plural&quot;&gt;shekel&lt;/i&gt; was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams&lt;/note&gt;\">3</a></sup> of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.</p>\n<p id=\"p01037028_08-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>and returned to his brothers and said, “The boy is gone, and I, where shall I go?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>Then they took Joseph’s robe and slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>And they sent the robe of many colors and brought it to their father and said, “This we have found; please identify whether it is your son’s robe or not.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>And he identified it and said, “It is my son’s robe. A fierce animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, “No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.” Thus his father wept for him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01037036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.</p>\n<h3 id=\"p01038001_08-1\">Judah and Tamar</h3>\n<p id=\"p01038001_11-1\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v01038001-1\">38&nbsp;</b>It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and turned aside to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her and went in to her, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>Yet again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. Judah<sup class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"fn\" href=\"#f4-1\" id=\"fb4-1\" title=\"&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;He&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;\">4</a></sup> was in Chezib when she bore him.</p>\n<p id=\"p01038005_11-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>Then Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his. So whenever he went in to his brother’s wife he would waste the semen on the ground, so as not to give offspring to his brother. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>And what he did was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and he put him to death also. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house, till Shelah my son grows up”—for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and remained in her father’s house.</p>\n<p id=\"p01038011_11-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>In the course of time the wife of Judah, Shua’s daughter, died. When Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>And when Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>she took off her widow’s garments and covered herself with a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she had not been given to him in marriage. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01038016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>He turned to her at the roadside and said, “Come, let me come in to you,” for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.

As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01040011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01040012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01040013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you shall place Pharaoh’s cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his cupbearer. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01040014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>Only remember me, when it is well with you, and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01040015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit.”</p>\n<p id=\"p01040015_10-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01040016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01040017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01040018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>And Joseph answered and said, “This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01040019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head—from you!—and hang you on a tree.

Go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live and not die.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01042003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01042004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might happen to him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01042005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</p>\n<p id=\"p01042005_06-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01042006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>Now Joseph was governor over the land.

And he said to them, “You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01042010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>They said to him, “No, my lord, your servants have come to buy food. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01042011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>We are all sons of one man.

So your words will be verified, and you shall not die.” And they did so. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01042021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>Then they said to one another, “In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us and we did not listen.

So now there comes a reckoning for his blood.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01042023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01042024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>Then he turned away from them and wept.

One is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.’ <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01042033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01042034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>Bring your youngest brother to me.

And when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01042036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>And Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has come against me.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01042037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>Then Reuben said to his father, “Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01042038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is the only one left.

Your God and the God of your father has put treasure in your sacks for you.

Is he still alive?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01043028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>They said, “Your servant our father is well; he is still alive.” And they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01043029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01043030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph hurried out, for his compassion grew warm for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01043031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>Then he washed his face and came out. And controlling himself he said, “Serve the food.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01043032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01043033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth.

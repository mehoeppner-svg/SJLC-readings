<p id="p01016001_04-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01016001-1">16&nbsp;</b>Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar. <b class="verse-num" id="v01016002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And Sarai said to Abram, “Behold now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;sound-alike&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;be built up&lt;/i&gt;, which sounds like the Hebrew for &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;children&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. <b class="verse-num" id="v01016003-1">3&nbsp;</b>So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife. <b class="verse-num" id="v01016004-1">4&nbsp;</b>And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived.

May the LORD judge between you and me!” <b class="verse-num" id="v01016006-1">6&nbsp;</b>But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your servant is in your power; do to her as you please.” Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.</p>

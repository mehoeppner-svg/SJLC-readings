<p id="p01021022_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01021022-1">22&nbsp;</b>At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021023-1">23&nbsp;</b>Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01021024-1">24&nbsp;</b>And Abraham said, “I will swear.”</p>
<p id="p01021024_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01021025-1">25&nbsp;</b>When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech’s servants had seized, <b class="verse-num" id="v01021026-1">26&nbsp;</b>Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01021027-1">27&nbsp;</b>So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021028-1">28&nbsp;</b>Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021029-1">29&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?” <b class="verse-num" id="v01021030-1">30&nbsp;</b>He said, “These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> may be a witness for me that I dug this well.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01021031-1">31&nbsp;</b>Therefore that place was called Beersheba,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Beersheba&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;well of seven&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;well of the oath&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> because there both of them swore an oath. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021032-1">32&nbsp;</b>So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021033-1">33&nbsp;</b>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. <b class="verse-num" id="v01021034-1">34&nbsp;</b>And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.</p>

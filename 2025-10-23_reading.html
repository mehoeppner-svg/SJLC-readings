<p id="p01018001_01-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01018001-1">18&nbsp;</b>And the LORD appeared to him by the oaks<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;terebinths&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day. <b class="verse-num" id="v01018002-1">2&nbsp;</b>He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing in front of him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth <b class="verse-num" id="v01018003-1">3&nbsp;</b>and said, “O Lord,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;My lord&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant. <b class="verse-num" id="v01018004-1">4&nbsp;</b>Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree, <b class="verse-num" id="v01018005-1">5&nbsp;</b>while I bring a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on—since you have come to your servant.” So they said, “Do as you have said.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01018006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And Abraham went quickly into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quick! Three seahs<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;background&quot; sub-class=&quot;measurement&quot;&gt;A &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word-plural&quot;&gt;seah&lt;/i&gt; was about 7.7 quarts or 7.3 liters&lt;/note&gt;">3</a></sup> of fine flour! Knead it, and make cakes.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01018007-1">7&nbsp;</b>And Abraham ran to the herd and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to a young man, who prepared it quickly. <b class="verse-num" id="v01018008-1">8&nbsp;</b>Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them. And he stood by them under the tree while they ate.</p>
<p id="p01018008_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01018009-1">9&nbsp;</b>They said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” And he said, “She is in the tent.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01018010-1">10&nbsp;</b>The LORD said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife shall have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him. <b class="verse-num" id="v01018011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years. The way of women had ceased to be with Sarah. <b class="verse-num" id="v01018012-1">12&nbsp;</b>So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, “After I am worn out, and my lord is old, shall I have pleasure?” <b class="verse-num" id="v01018013-1">13&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?’ <b class="verse-num" id="v01018014-1">14&nbsp;</b>Is anything too hard<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;wonderful&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, about this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01018015-1">15&nbsp;</b>But Sarah denied it,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;acted falsely&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">5</a></sup> saying, “I did not laugh,” for she was afraid. He said, “No, but you did laugh.”</p>
